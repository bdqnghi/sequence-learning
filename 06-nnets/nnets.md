[Wheat Seeds Dataset](06-nnets/wheat-seeds.zip)

# Perceptron

Implement the perceptron using the incremental training algorithm.

[solution](06-nnets/perceptron.py)


# Multi-layer Perceptron and Backpropagation

Implement a basic neural network using a sigmoid activation function and backpropagation training.

[solution](06-nnets/nnets.py)


# Hotwords Recognition

Please work your way through the TensorFlow [hotword recognition tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio_recognition) (you need to install [bazel](https://www.bazel.build/), Google's build tool, e.g. using homebrew on a Mac or using your package manager on linux).
