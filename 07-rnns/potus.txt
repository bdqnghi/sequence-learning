china just agreed that the u.s will be allowed to sell beef and other major products into china once again this is real news
when james clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt says there is no collusion when does it end?
james comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press
 maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future  press briefings  and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???
as a very active president with lots of things happening it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy .
the fake media is working overtime today
again the story that there was collusion between the russians & trump campaign was fabricated by dems as an excuse for losing the election.
yesterday on the same day i had meetings with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and the fm of ukraine pavlo
russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the u.s tears itself apart over a democrat excuse for losing the election.
we finally agree on something rosie
'presidential executive order on the establishment of presidential advisory commission on election integrity'
'presidential executive order on strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure
the democrats should be ashamed this is a disgrace #draintheswamp
dems have been complaining for months & months about dir comey now that he has been fired they pretend to be aggrieved phony hypocrites
the roger stone report on @cnn is false fake news have not spoken to roger in a long time had nothing to do with my decision.
caught he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness and now he is judge & jury he should be the one who is investigated for his acts.
years as a pol in connecticut blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in vietnam except he was never there when .
watching senator richard blumenthal speak of comey is a joke  richie  devised one of the greatest military frauds in u.s history for .
comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in washington republican and democrat alike when things calm down they will be thanking me
james comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job bringing back the spirit and prestige of the fbi.
the democrats have said some of the worst things about james comey including the fact that he should be fired but now they play so sad
ryin' chuck schumer stated recently  i do not have confidence in him (james comey) any longer.  then acts so indignant #draintheswamp

democrats used to support border security — now they want illegals to pour through our borders.
democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies it is time to put #americafirst🇺🇸
what's more important? rebuilding our military or bailing out insurance companies? ask the democrats.
i promise to rebuild our military and secure our border democrats want to shut down the government politics
i want to help our miners while the democrats are blocking their healthcare.
the democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out puerto rico and give billions to their insurance companies for ocare failure no
 subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all we will then terminate nafta relationships are good-deal very possible
i received calls from the president of mexico and the prime minister of canada asking to renegotiate nafta rather than terminate i agreed

the two fake news polls released yesterday abc & nbc while containing some very positive info were totally wrong in general e watch
 popular vote abc news/washington post poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.
new polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is fake and almost always negative would still beat hillary in
eventually but at a later date so we can get started early mexico will be paying in some form for the badly needed border wall.
the democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad ms 13 gang members.
obamacare is in serious trouble the dems need big money to keep it going otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.

 long he doesn't know how to win anymore just look at the mess our country is in bogged down in conflict all over the place our hero
en mccain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media only emboldens the enemy he's been losing so .
hris cuomo in his interview with sen blumenthal never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave  service  in vietnam fake news
en.richard blumenthal who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him?

njoy the #superbowl and then we continue make america great again
 have instructed homeland security to check people coming into our country very carefully the courts are making the job very difficult

nterview with @oreillyfactor on fox network 4:00 p.m (prior to super bowl) enjoy
hy aren't the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
ecause the ban was lifted by a judge many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country a terrible decision
hat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into u.s.?
ake america great again
fter being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the fake news @nytimes is still lost
he opinion of this so-called judge which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned
nteresting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban they know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction
hen a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in & out especially for reasons of safety &.security big trouble
ountries charge u.s companies taxes or tariffs while the u.s charges them nothing or little.we should charge them same as they charge us
